### AuraLink 
AuraLink is a wearable gestural interface that turns hand movements into digital commands. 

### The Vision
To create a seamless bridge between physical motion and software control, allowing creators to "sculpt" sound or control interfaces without touching a mouse.

### Current Status
- **Simulation:** 100% functional in Wokwi (Check `hardware/` for proof).
- **Logic:** Firmware supports 5-finger tracking and 6-axis motion.
- **Goal:** Apply for Hack Club Blueprint to build the physical prototype.

### Folder Guide
- `/firmware`: Arduino/C++ code for the ESP32.
