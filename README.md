AuraLink is a wearable glove that translates hand movements into digital commands its more like conducting music or sculpting sound without ever touching a mouse.
The idea came from me wanting a more physical, intuitive way to interact with software. Instead of clicking and dragging, you just move your hands.
the whole thing is fully simulated in Wokwi (see the hardware folder), the firmware handles all 5 fingers plus 6-axis motion tracking, and I'm currently applying for Hack Club Blueprint to fund the physical build.
Thanks for reading my readme!
